Hello! I'm Tyler Chae. I'm a professional software engineer, aspiring entrepreneur, and amature photographer.

I believe the value of a software is coming from what problem that it solves.
At U-Systems, which later acquired by GE Healthcare, I learned and used QT/QML, C++, OpenGL, and a bit of CUDA to build a 3D ultrasound device for breast cancer.
I learned Nodejs, Angular, Express, MongoDb to build a web app to connect students with therapist.
Using Unity3d for VR/AR prototype including shader programming that solves medical problems.
Now Iâ€™m at Mixpanel, using golang, Kubernetes, GCP, Wavefront to provide analytics data for businesses.
